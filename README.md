## Understand what this license means

The whole idea is that we can **mash-up** each other's work by giving original credits.

**First**, let's **Seth Godin** explain what it is. Taken from Seth's podcast Akimbo, episode "All rights reserved." This worths 1m40 of your time. https://pascalandy.com/blog/what-is-the-gnu-gpl-license/

**Second**, here is Plain English explanation by the GNU's creator **Richard Stallman**.

## Why forking this license?

I wanted a clean **Markdown** version of the license.

No matter how I trust the open-source community, **I feel itâ€™s not best practice** to: 

- Use a link that points to a licence written by a third party
- Use licence(s) proposed by GitHub

If any changes happen, how do you know it's still right for you? By using scenario #1 or #2, you could put yourself in a position where you may lose control of what the licence was supposed to mean at the moment you read it.

I believe everyone should fork the licence they want to use on their git repo.
