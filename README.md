## Understand what this license means

The whole idea is that we can **mash-up** each other's work by giving original credits.

Hear what is the GNU GPL license by **Seth Godin**. Taken from Seth's podcast Akimbo, episode "All rights reserved". This worths 1m40 of your time.

Second, here is Plain english explanation by the GNU's creator. Watch **Richard Stallman** explains the idea.

## Why forking this license?

**First**, I wanted a clean **Markdown** version of the license.

**Second**, no matter how I trust the open source community, **I feel it’s not best practice** to: 
- Use a link that points to a licence written by a third party
- Use licence(s) proposed by GitHub

If any changes happen, how do you know it's still right for you? By using scenario #1 or #2, you could put yourself in a position where you may lose the control of what the licence was supposed to mean at the moment you read it.

I believe everyone should fork the licence they want to use on their own repos.
